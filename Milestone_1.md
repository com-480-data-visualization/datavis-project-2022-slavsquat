# Milestone 1 - Data Visualization project on the Barcelona dataset

## Dataset

Being ranked very high one the list of best places to live in Europe, Barcelona represents an attractive location for pepople all around the world when it comes to residential choice, holidays, personal and business meet-ups, conferences, etc. Having beautiful architecture, wonderful food, excellent public transportation and amazing weather, it hosts around seven million visitors annually and organizes more than 1000 events. With all daily news, that is presented outside the Spain, normally going into this direction, most of people started associating Barcelona only with previously mentioned points, which has consequenly ensured its steady development and growth over the last 20 years. However, little could be read about the big immigration it has, as well as about the number of accidenets and deaths happening. Moreover, insignificantly small number of studies has been conducted so far, trying to find correlations between different events happened and the city organization itself (e.g. number of accidents in different neighbourhoods to increase safety of the population), in order to improve the its structure and make changes.  

Acknowledged by Barcelona City Council and Barcelona Digital City, Barcelona data set consists of different subsets containg the information about various aspects of the city, offering a possibility to tackle many issues. Ones that are going to be used in this study are deaths.csv, population.csv, immigrants_by_nationality.csv, immigrants_emigrants_by_age.csv, immigrants_emigrants_by_destination.csv, immigrants_emigrants_by_destination2.csv, immigrants_emigrants_by_sex.csv and accidents_2017.csv, containing the data about population in different Barcelona neighbourhoods, accidents and immigration statistics.
